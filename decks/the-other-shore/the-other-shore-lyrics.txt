Verse 1:
剪 一阵风 抖落在水月中
谁 躲藏在 回忆中不愿先走
捡 一个梦 趁夜色正朦胧
在他苏醒之前 有始有终
 
Verse 2:
她看过漫山遍野 那覆盖一切
被夺目红色染脏的雪
她穿过 昼与夜 与陨落的星擦肩
寻访未曾见过的叶
 
Verse 3:
她熬过漫长冬月 想见你一面
寂寞纠缠成一根红线
她恍然 微醺间 往事浮现于眼前
是谁的 容颜
 
Interlude:
啊 啊 啊
 
Chorus:
剪 一阵风 抖落在水月中
谁 躲藏在 回忆中不愿先走
捡 一个梦 趁夜色正朦胧
在他苏醒之前 有始有终
多少次擦肩才能换一次回眸

她

English:

Verse 1:
Slice a gust of wind which falls into the water reflected moon
Who hides within the memories, unwilling to leave first?
Pocket a dream while the night is still dimmed
Before he awakens, it begins and ends

Verse 2:
She's seen all the mountains and every plain, that which covers everything
Snow which has been stained with dazzling red
She's passed through night and day, rubbed shoulders with fallen stars
Looking for never seen before leaves

Verse 3:
She survived the long months of winter, wanting to catch a glimpse of you
Loneliness tangling into a red thread
Suddenly when drunk, events of the past flashed across her eyes
Whose face was that?

Interlude:
Ah ah ah
 
Chorus:
Slice a gust of wind which falls into the water reflected moon
Who hides within the memories, unwilling to leave first?
Pocket a dream while the night is still dimmed
Before he awakens, it begins and ends
How many times does one need to rub shoulders for a glance backwards?

[Additional verses - appears to continue with more content:]
She's seen all the mountains and every plain, that which covers everything
Snow which has been stained with dazzling red
She's passed through night and day, rubbed shoulders with fallen stars
Looking for never seen before

She cradled mirrored flowers and a water reflected moon, within a moment they disintegrated
A trip to the world of mortals is a flash in the pan
She crosses a boat, forgets the river, hiding half a jade within her palm
Drinking up a bowl, once upon a time

Trim a bud of red which falls into the water reflected moon
She turned but there was nothing left to be seen
