忽近忽远 She comes, she goes
忽隐忽现 She hides, she shows
忽明忽暗 She lights, she folds
忽快忽慢 she slows, she bolts

她不停的旋转 She spins into eternity
无休止的节拍 On a beat running constantly
她不停的旋转 She spins into eternity
在空荡的舞台 On a stage that’s empty

太近太远 Too close and too far
太深太浅 Too deep and too shoal
无声无影 No form and no sound
无边无尽 No end and no bound

她不停的旋转 She spins into eternity
无休止的节拍 On a beat running constantly
她不停的旋转 She spins into eternity
在荒唐的舞台 In the theater of absurdity

她说她是透明的 She says she comes invisibly
她说她快熄灭了 She says she goes blindly
她说她是电动的 She says she runs on electricity
她说他是下一个 She says he is the next to be

舞台下的观众 All the audience below
在等着你出丑 Waiting for you to blow
而幕布的背后 Somewhere behind the show
还有人在操纵 Somebody is in control

她想说 她想问 她是谁 She wants to know; she wants to ask; oh who am I?
一直转 一直转 是为了谁 Spinning on and spinning in; oh why am I?
她想说 她想问 她是谁 She wants to know; she wants to ask; oh who am I?
地球说你不用管 就跟我转 The Earth answers it matters not; just spin with me
